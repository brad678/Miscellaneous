### Project details: 


#### Domain: Entertainment
#### Project: IMDB - Recommendation
#### Data: movie_metadata.csv

#### Description
- This dataset contains 28 variables for 5043 movies, spanning across 100 years in 66 countries. There are 2399 unique director names, and thousands of actors/actresses. Below are the 28 variables:

movie_title

#### Objective
- Given that thousands of movies were produced each year, is there a better way for us to tell the greatness of movie without relying on critics or our own instincts? And try to create a recommendation engine with this dataset.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


### Loading required packages

```{r}

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)

```


### Loading the data

```{r}

movies <- read.csv('movie_metadata.csv',stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
glimpse(movies)
summary(movies)

```

The missing values are present in:

num_critic_for_reviews(50)                                
duration(15)                                      
director_facebbok_likes(104)                       
actor_3_facebook_likes(23)                       
actor_1_facebook_likes(7)                             
gross(884)                               
facenumber_in_poster(13)                              
num_user_for_reviews(21)                               
budget(492)                                        
title_year(108)                                          
actor_2_facebook_likes(13)                          
aspect_ratio(329)                                     


### Removing the duplcate movies

```{r}

idx_dup <- which(duplicated(movies$movie_title)==TRUE)
movies <- movies[-idx_dup,]


```


### Finding columns and rows with missing values using function
```{r}
miss <- function(x) {
 cat('\nThe columns having missing values are:')
 for(i in 1:ncol(x)) {
  if(length(x[i][is.na(x[i])]) > 0) {
    cat('\n',names(x[i]),':',length(x[i][is.na(x[i])]))
  }
 } 
  cat('\n\nThe number of rows with missing values are:',nrow(x)-nrow(na.omit(x)))
  cat('\nThe proportion of missing values is:',signif((nrow(x)-nrow(na.omit(x)))/nrow(x),2))
}

miss(movies)
```


### Removing rows with missing values in budget and gross
### Missing values in rest of the columns can be replaced with zeros

```{r}

# remove the rows having missing values in budget and gross
idx <- which(is.na(movies$budget)==TRUE)
movies <- movies[-idx,]

idx <- which(is.na(movies$gross)==TRUE)
movies <- movies[-idx,]
 
# replace with zeros
movies[is.na(movies)] <- 0

# checking the missing values
miss(movies)
 

```

Now the dataset is clean and ready


### Write into csv file so as to do visualizations in tableau

```{r}

write.csv(movies,'movies_tab.csv')


```


Can infer the following from plots:

- Majority of the scores are in range of 6-8
- Countries like China, Hong kong, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, UK have produced the average score of above 7 (min. count of movies is 10)
- UK produced lots of movies (313) with average Imdb score of 7
- US produced largest number of movies(2993), however their average imdb score is 6.5
- We can find that over the years(spcifically after 1975) the quality of movies(as per score) has come down. This might be partly due to the fact that large number of movies are being made.
- As the "movie facebook likes" increases, the score also increases. There are few outliers too like for instance "Interstellar" got the maximum likes(>350k) but score is only 8.6 where as "Godfather" got less than 50k likes but its score is 9.2
- There is positive relationship between "cast total FB likes" and Imdb score, however its not as strong as that of "movie facebook likes"
- As the duration of movie increases, the score also increases
- Generally speaking as the score of movie increases, the gross also increases. However the budgets for high gross earning movies is also high. 
For instance, movie like "Avatar" which made whopping gross had gross profit margin of 69% where as "A separation" made on comparitively less budget made gross profit margin of 93%
- The most succesful director(with min. 10 movies) is steven spielberg (both in terms of score and gross profit margin %)
- The Top actor score wise(with min. 10 movies) are Tom hanks, Leonardo Dicaprio and Clint Eastwood
- The Top actor-director combination(with min. 3 movies together) are Christain Bale-Christopher Nolan, Robert De Niro -Martin Scorsese, Leonardo Dicaprio -Martin Scorsese, Michael Biehn-James Cameron, Michael Moore-Michael Moore.
- More the "Num Voted users", better is the score. The movie with highest votes is "The shawshank Redemption"(9.3), followed by "The Dark Knight"(9) and "Inception"(8.8)



```{r}

library(corrplot)
x <- cor(movies[,unlist(lapply(movies, is.numeric))])
x
#corrplot(x,method='number',number.cex=0.75,col='blue')
corrplot(x,method='number',col='black',cl.pos = "n",number.cex=0.75)

```

Can infer that:

- The "imdb_score" has positive correlation with "num_voted_users". More the voted users, movies tend to have high rating.
- The "imdb_score" has small but positive correlation with "duration". Long movies tend to have high rating.
- The "imdb_score" has very small but positive correlation with the "director_facebook_likes", meaning a popular director does not necessarily mean his directed movie is great.
- The "imdb_score" has very small but positive correlation with the "actor_1_facebook_likes", meaning that an actor is popular in social network does not mean that a movie is high rating if he is the leading actor. 





The "imdb_score" has small but negative correlation with "facenumber_in_poster". It is perhaps not a good idea to have many faces in movie poster if a movie wants to be great.
The "imdb_score" has almost no correlation with "budget". Throwing money at a movie will not necessarily make it great.








The "cast_total_facebook_likes" has a strong positive correlation with the "actor_1_facebook_likes", and has smaller positive correlation with both "actor_2_facebook_likes" and "actor_3_facebook_likes"
The "movie_facebook_likes" has strong correlation with "num_critic_for_reviews", meaning that the popularity of a movie in social network can be largely affected by the critics
The "movie_facebook_likes" has relatively large correlation with the "num_voted_users"
The movie "gross" has strong positive correlation with the "num_voted_users"
Surprisingly, there are some pairwise correlations that are perhaps counter-intuitive:




### Principal component analysis (PCA)

```{r}
#biplot(prin_comp,scale=0)

std_dev <- prin_comp$sdev
pr_var <- std_dev^2

prop_var <- pr_var/sum(pr_var)

plot(prop_var,type='b',xlab = 'Number of Principal Components',ylab='Proportion of variance explained')
