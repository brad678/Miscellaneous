## Refresher 2

we're becoming good in ""R"" day by day.
Let's see how this notebook works

```{r}
print('This is coding section')
3+2
```
#### This is next section
```{r}
print('this is the new chunk introduced by us')
```
### New section

```{r}
x <- c(1.2,3.4,2.5)
class(x)
mode(x)
length(x)
```
```{r}
?subset
4+9
2-1
```
